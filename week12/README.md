## I. Reading and processing the NYT state-level COVID-19 data.

### 1. Read in the data

-   Read in the COVID data with data.table:fread() from the NYT GitHub
    repository:
    “<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv>”
-   Read in the state population data with data.table:fread() from the
    repository:
    “<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COVID19Tracking/associated-data/master/us_census_data/us_census_2018_population_estimates_states.csv>”"
-   Merge datasets

``` r
## data extracted from New York Times state-level data from NYT Github repository
# https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

## state-level population information from us_census_data available on GitHub repository:
# https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/associated-data/tree/master/us_census_data

# load COVID state-level data from NYT
cv_states <- as.data.frame(data.table::fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv"))

# load state population data
state_pops <- as.data.frame(data.table::fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/COVID19Tracking/associated-data/master/us_census_data/us_census_2018_population_estimates_states.csv"))
state_pops$abb <- state_pops$state
state_pops$state <- state_pops$state_name
state_pops$state_name <- NULL

cv_states <- merge(cv_states, state_pops, by= "state")
```

### 2. Look at the data

-   Inspect the dimensions, `head`, and `tail` of the data
-   Inspect the structure of each variables. Are they in the correct
    format?

``` r
dim(cv_states)
```

    ## [1] 32250     9

head(cv_states)
```

*The variables are all in the correct format.*

### 3. Format the data

-   Make date into a date variable, by year-month-day
-   Make state into a factor variable (what is that?)
-   Order the data first by state, second by date
-   Confirm the variables are now correctly formatted
-   Inspect the range values for each variable. What is the date range?
    The range of cases and deaths?

``` r
# format the date
cv_states$date <- as.Date(cv_states$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")

# format the state and state abbreviation (abb) variables
state_list <- unique(cv_states$state)
cv_states$state <- factor(cv_states$state, levels = state_list) # what is this?
abb_list <- unique(cv_states$abb)
cv_states$abb <- factor(cv_states$abb, levels = abb_list)

# order the data first by state, second by date
cv_states = cv_states[order(cv_states$state, cv_states$date),]

# Confirm the variables are now correctly formatted
str(cv_states)
```

### 4. Add `new_cases` and `new_deaths` and correct outliers

-   Add variables for new cases, `new_cases`, and new deaths,
    `new_deaths`
    -   Hint: You can set `new_cases` equal to the difference between
        cases on date i and date i-1, starting on date i=2
-   Filter to dates after June 1, 2021
-   Use `plotly` for EDA: See if there are outliers or values that don’t
    make sense for `new_cases` and `new_deaths`. Which states and which
    dates have strange values?
-   Correct outliers: Set negative values for `new_cases` or
    `new_deaths` to 0
-   Recalculate `cases` and `deaths` as cumulative sum of updated
    `new_cases` and `new_deaths`
-   Get the rolling average of new cases and new deaths to smooth over
    time
-   Inspect data again interactively

``` r
# Add variables for new_cases and new_deaths:
for (i in 1:length(state_list)) {
  cv_subset = subset(cv_states, state == state_list[i]) # subset for just one state
  cv_subset = cv_subset[order(cv_subset$date),] # order that state by date
  
  # add starting level for new cases and deaths 
  cv_subset$new_cases = cv_subset$cases[1] 
  cv_subset$new_deaths = cv_subset$deaths[1] 
  
  for (j in 2:nrow(cv_subset)) {
    cv_subset$new_cases[j] = cv_subset$cases[j] - cv_subset$cases[j-1] 
    cv_subset$new_deaths[j] = cv_subset$deaths[j] - cv_subset$deaths[j-1]
  }
  
  # include in main dataset
  cv_states$new_cases[cv_states$state==state_list[i]] = cv_subset$new_cases 
  cv_states$new_deaths[cv_states$state==state_list[i]] = cv_subset$new_deaths
}

# Focus on recent dates
cv_states <- cv_states %>% dplyr::filter(date >= "2021-06-01")

# Inspect outliers in new_cases using plotly
p1<-ggplot(cv_states, aes(x = date, y = new_cases, color = state)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
#ggplotly(p1)
p1<-NULL # to clear from work space
p2<-ggplot(cv_states, aes(x = date, y = new_deaths, color = state)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
#ggplotly(p2)
p2<-NULL # to clear from work space

# set negative new case or death counts to 0
cv_states$new_cases[cv_states$new_cases<0] = 0
cv_states$new_deaths[cv_states$new_deaths<0] = 0

# Recalculate `cases` and `deaths` as cumulative sum of updated `new_cases` and `new_deaths`
for (i in 1:length(state_list)) {
  cv_subset = subset(cv_states, state == state_list[i])
  
  # add starting level for new cases and deaths
  cv_subset$cases = cv_subset$cases[1]
  cv_subset$deaths = cv_subset$deaths[1]
  
  for (j in 2:nrow(cv_subset)) {
    cv_subset$cases[j] = cv_subset$new_cases[j] + cv_subset$cases[j-1]
    cv_subset$deaths[j] = cv_subset$new_deaths[j] + cv_subset$deaths[j-1]
  }
  
  # include in main data set
  cv_states$cases[cv_states$state==state_list[i]] = cv_subset$cases
  cv_states$deaths[cv_states$state==state_list[i]] = cv_subset$deaths
}

# Smooth new counts
cv_states$new_cases = zoo::rollmean(cv_states$new_cases, k=7, fill=NA, align='right') %>% round(digits = 0)
cv_states$new_deaths = zoo::rollmean(cv_states$new_deaths, k=7, fill=NA, align='right') %>% round(digits = 0)

# Use ggplotly to inspect smoothened new_deaths data for each state
p2<-ggplot(cv_states, aes(x = date, y = new_deaths, color = state)) + geom_line() + geom_point(size = .5, alpha = 0.5)
#ggplotly(p2)

p2=NULL
```

### 5. Add additional variables

-   Add population-normalized (by 100,000) variables for each variable
    type (rounded to 1 decimal place). Make sure the variables you
    calculate are in the correct format (`numeric`). You can use the
    following variable names:

    -   `per100k` = cases per 100,000 population
    -   `newper100k`= new cases per 100,000
    -   `deathsper100k` = deaths per 100,000
    -   `newdeathsper100k` = new deaths per 100,000

-   Add a “naive CFR” variable representing `deaths / cases` on each
    date for each state

-   Create a dataframe representing values on the most recent date,
    `cv_states_today`, as done in lecture

``` r
# add population normalized (by 100,000) counts for each variable
cv_states$per100k =  as.numeric(format(round(cv_states$cases/(cv_states$population/100000),1),nsmall=1))
cv_states$newper100k =  as.numeric(format(round(cv_states$new_cases/(cv_states$population/100000),1),nsmall=1))
cv_states$deathsper100k =  as.numeric(format(round(cv_states$deaths/(cv_states$population/100000),1),nsmall=1))
cv_states$newdeathsper100k =  as.numeric(format(round(cv_states$new_deaths/(cv_states$population/100000),1),nsmall=1))

# add a naive_CFR variable = deaths / cases
cv_states = cv_states %>% mutate(naive_CFR = round((deaths*100/cases),2))

# create a `cv_states_today` variable
cv_states_today = subset(cv_states, date==max(cv_states$date))
```

## II. Scatterplots

### 6. Explore scatterplots using `plot_ly()`

-   Create a scatterplot using `plot_ly()` representing `pop_density`
    vs. various variables (e.g. `cases`, `per100k`, `deaths`,
    `deathsper100k`) for each state on most recent date
    (`cv_states_today`)
    -   Color points by state and size points by state population
    -   Use hover to identify any outliers.
    -   Remove those outliers and re-plot.
-   Choose one plot. For this plot:
    -   Add hoverinfo specifying the state name, cases per 100k, and
        deaths per 100k, similar to how we did this in the lecture notes
    -   Add layout information to title the chart and the axes
    -   Enable `hovermode = "compare"`

``` r
# pop_density vs. cases
cv_states_today %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~pop_density, y = ~cases, 
          type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', color = ~state,
          size = ~population, sizes = c(5, 25), marker = list(sizemode='diameter', opacity=0.5))
```

### 7. Explore scatterplot trend interactively using `ggplotly()` and `geom_smooth()`

-   Use `ggplotly` to explore `pop_density` vs. `newdeathsper100k`
-   Explore the pattern between *x* and *y* using `geom_smooth()`
    -   Explain what you see. Do you think `pop_density` is a correlate
        of `newdeathsper100k`?

``` r
# 
p <- ggplot(cv_states_today_filter, aes(x=pop_density, y=newdeathsper100k, size=population)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
ggplotly(p)
```

There does not appear to be a strong correlation between population
density and new deaths, at least when looking at the most recent day’s
worth of data.

### 8. Multiple line chart

-   Create a line chart of the `naive_CFR` for all states over time
    using `plot_ly()`
    -   Use the zoom and pan tools to inspect the `naive_CFR` for the
        states that had an increase in September. How have they changed
        over time?
-   Create one more line chart, for Florida only, which shows
    `new_cases` and `new_deaths` together in one plot. Hint: use
    `add_layer()`
    -   Use hoverinfo to “eyeball” the approximate peak of deaths and
        peak of cases. What is the time delay between the peak of cases
        and the peak of deaths?

``` r
# Line chart for naive_CFR for all states over time using `plot_ly()`
plot_ly(cv_states, x = ~date, y = ~naive_CFR, color = ~state, type = "scatter", mode = "lines")

### 9. Heatmaps

Create a heatmap to visualize `new_cases` for each state on each date
greater than June 1st, 2021 - Start by mapping selected features in the
dataframe into a matrix using the **tidyr** package function
`pivot_wider()`, naming the rows and columns. - Use `plot_ly()` to
create a heatmap out of this matrix. Which states stand out? - Repeat
with `newper100k` variable. Now which states stand out? - Create a
second heatmap in which the pattern of `new_cases` for each state over
time becomes more clear by filtering to only look at dates every two
weeks

``` r
# Map state, date, and new_cases to a matrix
library(tidyr)

cv_states_mat <- cv_states %>% select(state, date, new_cases) %>% dplyr::filter(date>as.Date("2021-06-15"))
cv_states_mat2 <- as.data.frame(pivot_wider(cv_states_mat, names_from = state, values_from = new_cases))
rownames(cv_states_mat2) <- cv_states_mat2$date
cv_states_mat2$date <- NULL
cv_states_mat2 <- as.matrix(cv_states_mat2) #heatmap requires a matrix input

# Create a heatmap using plot_ly()
plot_ly(x=colnames(cv_states_mat2), y=rownames(cv_states_mat2),
             z=~cv_states_mat2,
             type="heatmap",
             showscale=T)

### 10. Map

-   Create a map to visualize the `naive_CFR` by state on October 15,
    2021
-   Compare with a map visualizing the `naive_CFR` by state on most
    recent date
-   Plot the two maps together using `subplot()`. Make sure the shading
    is for the same range of values
-   Describe the difference in the pattern of the CFR
